### Give it a try today
A very simple `hello world` function would be:

```ruby
def main(args)
  name = args["name"] || "stranger"
  greeting = "Hello #{name}!"
  puts greeting
  { "greeting" => greeting }
end
```

For the return result, not only support `dictionary` but also support `array`

So a very simple `hello array` function would be:

```ruby
def main(args)
  nums = Array["a","b"]
  nums
end
```

And support array result for sequence action as well, the first action's array result can be used as next action's input parameter.

So the function can be

```ruby
def main(args)
  args
end
```

To use as a docker action
```
wsk action update myAction my_action.rb --docker openwhisk/action-ruby-v2.5
```
This works on any deployment of Apache OpenWhisk

### To use on deployment that contains the runtime as a kind
To use as a kind action
```
wsk action update myAction my_action.rb --kind ruby:2.5
```

### Local development
```
./gradlew core:ruby2.5Action:distDocker
```
This will produce the image `whisk/action-ruby-v2.5`

Build and Push image
```
docker login
./gradlew core:ruby2.5Action:distDocker -PdockerImagePrefix=$prefix-user -PdockerRegistry=docker.io
```

Deploy OpenWhisk using ansible environment that contains the kind `ruby:2.5`
Assuming you have OpenWhisk already deploy locally and `OPENWHISK_HOME` pointing to root directory of OpenWhisk core repository.

Set `ROOTDIR` to the root directory of this repository.

Redeploy OpenWhisk
```
cd $OPENWHISK_HOME/ansible
ANSIBLE_CMD="ansible-playbook -i ${ROOTDIR}/ansible/environments/local"
$ANSIBLE_CMD setup.yml
$ANSIBLE_CMD couchdb.yml
$ANSIBLE_CMD initdb.yml
$ANSIBLE_CMD wipe.yml
$ANSIBLE_CMD openwhisk.yml
```

Or you can use `wskdev` and create a soft link to the target ansible environment, for example:
```
ln -s ${ROOTDIR}/ansible/environments/local ${OPENWHISK_HOME}/ansible/environments/local-ruby
wskdev fresh -t local-ruby
```

To use as docker action push to your own dockerhub account
```
docker tag whisk/ruby2.5Action $user_prefix/action-ruby-v2.5
docker push $user_prefix/action-ruby-v2.5
```
Then create the action using your image from Docker Hub.
```
wsk action update myAction my_action.rb --docker $user_prefix/action-ruby-v2.5
```
The `$user_prefix` is usually your dockerhub user id.

### Testing
Install dependencies from the root directory on $OPENWHISK_HOME repository
```
./gradlew install
```

Using gradle to run all tests
```
./gradlew :tests:test
```
Using gradle to run some tests
```
./gradlew :tests:test --tests *ActionContainerTests*
```
Using IntelliJ:
- Import project as gradle project.
- Make sure the working directory is root of the project/repo.
